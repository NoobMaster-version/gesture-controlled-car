# gesture-controlled-car
A wireless RC car controlled by hand gestures using two ESP32 modules, an MPU6050 sensor, and the ESP-NOW protocol. Tilt the sender module to control the car's direction (forward, backward, left, right). This repository includes Arduino code for the sender, receiver, and MAC address retrieval, along with setup instructions.
